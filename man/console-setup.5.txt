1mNAME0m
       console-setup - configuration file for setupcon

1mDESCRIPTION0m
       The  file  1mconsole-setup 22mspecifies the encoding and the font to be used
       by 1msetupcon22m(1) in order to setup the console.  It can be used  also  to
       specify  the  keyboard  layout  but it is not recommended to do so, use
       1mkeyboard22m(5) instead.

       The font specification consists of three  parameters  -  codeset,  font
       face and font size.  The codeset specifies what characters will be sup-
       ported  by  the  font.   There  isn't one-to-one correspondence between
       codeset and encoding, for example the codeset  1mLat15  22mis  suitable  for
       ISO 8859-1,  ISO 8859-9  and ISO 8859-15.  The codesets are two kinds -
       small and big.  Only small codesets are supported on FreeBSD.

       The font face determines the general look of the font.  Each font  face
       is available in certain possible sizes.  On FreeBSD only 1m8x1622m, 1m8x14 22mand
       1m8x8  22mare  valid  sizes.   On  Linux  if framebuffer is not used or 1mcon-0m
       1msolechars22m(1) is installed instead of  1msetfont22m(1),  then  the  permitted
       sizes have the form 8x4mNUMBER24m.


       The  console  driver  of FreeBSD permits fonts in different sizes to be
       simultaneously loaded.  Which one of them will be actually used depends
       on the current video mode.  Therefore, on this platform the  font  size
       specification  will  be  ignored and 1msetupcon22m(1) will load the selected
       font face in all available sizes.

       The file 1mconsole-setup 22mconsists of variable settings in POSIX format:

              4mVARIABLE24m='4mVALUE24m'

       Only one assignment is allowed per line.  Comments (starting with  '#')
       are also allowed.


1mOPTIONS0m
       The following variables can be set.


       1mACTIVE_CONSOLES0m
              Specifies  the  device files in 4m/dev24m of the virtual terminals to
              be configured.  File name wild-cards (1m*22m, 1m?22m)   are  allowed.   On
              Linux usually you can set this to 1m/dev/tty[1-6] 22mand on FreeBSD a
              sensible  value is 1m/dev/ttyv[0-8]22m.  You can assign to this vari-
              able also the special value 1mguess22m.  It will cause 1msetupcon22m(1) to
              attempt to guess the active virtual consoles by looking in  con-
              figuration  files  such  as  4m/etc/inittab24m  and  4m/etc/ttys24m.  This
              guessing is not always reliable.


       1mCHARMAP0m
              Specifies the desired encoding on  the  console.   Valid  values
              are: 1mUTF-822m, 1mARMSCII-822m, 1mCP125122m, 1mCP125522m, 1mCP125622m, 1mGEORGIAN-ACADEMY22m,
              1mGEORGIAN-PS22m,   1mIBM113322m,   1mISIRI-334222m,   1mISO-8859-122m,  1mISO-8859-222m,
              1mISO-8859-322m,  1mISO-8859-422m,  1mISO-8859-522m,  1mISO-8859-622m,   1mISO-8859-722m,
              1mISO-8859-822m,  1mISO-8859-922m,  1mISO-8859-1022m, 1mISO-8859-1122m, 1mISO-8859-1322m,
              1mISO-8859-1422m, 1mISO-8859-1522m, 1mISO-8859-1622m, 1mKOI8-R22m,  1mKOI8-U22m,  1mTIS-6200m
              and 1mVISCII22m.  The special value 1mguess 22mis also recognized in which
              case  the system command 1mlocale22m(1) will be used to guess the de-
              sired encoding (currently this  works  reliably  only  with  GNU
              libc).


       1mCODESET0m
              In  most cases the special value 1mguess 22mcan be used here in which
              case a suitable codeset will be guessed.  The codeset determines
              which symbols are supported by the font.  Valid  small  codesets
              are:   1mArmenian22m,  1mCyrAsia22m,  1mCyrKoi22m,  1mCyrSlav22m,  1mGeorgian22m,  1mGreek22m,
              1mHebrew22m, 1mLao22m, 1mLat1522m, 1mLat222m, 1mLat3822m, 1mLat7 22mand 1mThai22m.  Valid big code-
              sets are: 1mArabic22m, 1mEthiopian22m, 1mUni122m, 1mUni222m,  1mUni3  22mand  1mVietnamese22m.
              Only  small codesets can be used on FreeBSD.  See below the sec-
              tion entitled "CODESETS" for detailed  description  of  each  of
              these codesets.


       1mFONTFACE 22mand 1mFONTSIZE0m
              Valid  font  faces  are:  1mVGA  22m(sizes 1m8x822m, 1m8x1422m, 1m8x1622m, 1m16x28 22mand
              1m16x3222m), 1mTerminus 22m(sizes 1m6x1222m, 1m8x1422m, 1m8x1622m,  1m10x2022m,  1m12x2422m,  1m14x280m
              and  1m16x3222m), 1mTerminusBold 22m(sizes 1m8x1422m, 1m8x1622m, 1m10x2022m, 1m12x2422m, 1m14x280m
              and 1m16x3222m), 1mTerminusBoldVGA 22m(sizes 1m8x14  22mand  1m8x1622m),  and  1mFixed0m
              (sizes   1m8x1322m,   1m8x1422m,   1m8x1522m,   1m8x16  22mand  1m8x1822m).   If  however
              1mCODESET22m=1mEthiopian22m, then the available font faces  are  1mGoha  22mand
              1mGohaClassic22m, each in sizes 1m8x1222m, 1m8x14 22mand 1m8x1622m.

              Set  1mFONTFACE  22mand 1mFONTSIZE 22mto empty strings if you want to con-
              figure only the keyboard and  to  leave  the  console  font  un-
              changed.


       1mVIDEOMODE0m
              Set  1mVIDEOMODE  22mto an empty string to avoid setting up the video
              mode.  On FreeBSD you can run

                  vidcontrol -i mode

              in order to see all possible video modes.  On Linux 1mfbset22m(1)  is
              used  to  configure  the  video mode but very often this doesn't
              work because the default framebuffer driver (VesaFB)  is  rather
              limited and doesn't allow changes of the video mode.


       1mFONT22m, 1mFONT_MAP 22mand 1mCONSOLE_MAP0m
              If  set,  specify  that  a non standard font is to be used.  The
              value of the variable 1mFONT 22mconsists of one or more  space  sepa-
              rated  font file names.  On Linux, when the font doesn't contain
              embedded Unicode map, an external map can be specified with  the
              variable  1mFONT_MAP22m.   The  value  of  1mCONSOLE_MAP 22mis a file that
              specifies a translation map from the user's  8-bit  encoding  to
              Unicode (Linux only) or directly to font positions.


       1mSCREEN_WIDTH 22mand 1mSCREEN_HEIGHT0m
              If  set,  these variables specify a screen size that 1msetupcon22m(1)
              will enforce with 1mstty22m(1).  This can be useful with some braille
              devices that are only 40 cells wide.  The screen  size  can  not
              exceed  what the current screen resolution can display according
              to the size of the loaded font.


       1mBEEP   22mThis variable controls the style of the system beep on the  con-
              sole.   When unset or when 1mBEEP=default 22mno changes to the system
              beep will be made.  Other possible values of 1mBEEP 22mare:  1mstandard0m
              1m-  22mset a standard beep; 1mshort - 22mlike the standard beep but some-
              what shorter; 1mshortest - 22meven more  short,  suitable  when  your
              work  generates  lots  of beeps; 1mpolite - 22ma very short beep with
              low frequency, suitable when there are other people in the room;
              1mattention - 22ma very long beep, suitable when  you  want  to  warn
              yourself  about an occurring event; 1mannoying - 22malso a long beep,
              suitable when you want to warn somebody else about an  occurring
              event; and 1moff - 22mdisable the system beep on the console.


1mCODESETS0m
       There are two kinds of codesets - small (up to 256 symbols) and big (up
       to 512 symbols).  Only small codesets can be used on FreeBSD.  When the
       screen is in text mode (i.e. framebuffer is not used) then fonts cover-
       ing big codesets will reduce the number of available foreground colors.

       The  standard  location  of  the  1mconsole-setup  22mconfiguration  file is
       4m/usr/local/etc/default/console-setup24m.  The keyboard configuration is in
       4m/usr/local/etc/default/keyboard24m.  Fonts that can be used with the vari-
       able  1mFONT  22mare  usually  installed  in   4m/usr/share/consolefonts/24m   or
       4m/usr/share/syscons/fonts/24m.   Translation maps that can be used with the
       variable CONSOLE_MAP are usually installed in  4m/usr/share/consoletrans/0m
       or 4m/usr/share/syscons/scrnmaps/24m.


1mNOTES0m
       The aim of the Terminus font is to reduce the eyes-fatigue when one has
       to read a lot.  Currently this font supports only the Latin, the Cyril-
       lic  and  the  Greek  scripts  (the 1mLat1522m, 1mLat222m, 1mLat722m, 1mCyrAsia22m, 1mCyrKoi22m,
       1mCyrSlav22m, 1mGreek22m, 1mUni2 22mand 1mUni3 22mcodesets).

       The fonts with font face 1mTerminusBoldVGA 22mare  optimized  for  use  with
       regular  text  video  modes.   They should not be used with framebuffer
       video modes.  The fonts with font face 1mTerminusBold 22mare  optimized  for
       use  with the framebuffer video modes.  The fonts with font face 1mTermi-0m
       1mnus 22mcan be used in all video modes.
