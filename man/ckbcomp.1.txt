1mNAME0m
       ckbcomp  -  compile a XKB keyboard description to a keymap suitable for
       loadkeys or kbdcontrol


1mSYNOPSIS0m
       1mckbcomp 22m[4mOPTION24m...] [4mXKBLAYOUT24m [4mXKBVARIANT24m [4mXKBOPTIONS24m]...]]


1mDESCRIPTION0m
       The 1mckbcomp 22mkeymap compiler converts a description of an  XKB  keyboard
       layout  into  a console keymap that can be read directly by 1mloadkeys22m(1)
       or 1mkbdcontrol22m(1).

       On its standard output 1mckbcomp 22mdumps the generated keyboard definition.
       The most important difference between the arguments of 1msetxkbmap22m(1) and
       the arguments of 1mckbcomp 22mis the additional parameter 4m-charmap24m when non-
       Unicode keyboard map is wanted.  Without 4m-charmap24m 1mckbcomp 22mwill generate
       Unicode keyboard.



1mOPTIONS0m
   1mGeneral options0m
       1m-?22m,1m-help0m
              Print a usage message and exit.

       1m-charmap 4m22mcharmap0m
              The encoding to use for the output keymap.  There should  be  an
              character  mapping  table  defining  this  encoding  in 4m/usr/lo-0m
              4mcal/share/consoletrans24m.  Definitions of the  following  charmaps
              are  provided:  1mARMSCII-822m,  1mCP125122m,  1mCP125522m,  1mCP125622m,  1mGEORGIAN-0m

       1m-I4m22mdir24m  Look in the top-level directory 4mdir24m for files  included  by  the
              keymap description.  This option may be used multiple times.  If
              a  file can not be found in any of the specified directories, it
              will be searched also in some other standard locations, such  as
              4m/usr/local/etc/console-setup/ckb24m,  4m/usr/local/share/X11/xkb24m  and
              4m/etc/X11/xkb0m


       1m-v 4m22mlevel0m
              Set level of detail for listing.  The argument 4mlevel24m must  be  a
              number from 1 to 10.

       1m-compact0m
              Generate  a  compact  keymap with at most two xkb groups and two
              levels in each or only one xkb-group and up to four levels.

       1m-freebsd0m
              Generate a keymap for FreeBSD.

       1m-backspace 22m[1mbs22m|1mdel22m]
              Specifies the behaviour of the <BackSpace>  and  <Delete>  keys.
              Value  1mbs 22mspecifies VT100-conformant behaviour: <BackSpace> will
              generate 1m^H 22m(ASCII BS) and <Delete>  will  generate  1m^?   22m(ASCII
              DEL).     Value   1mdel   22mspecifies   VT220-conformant   behavior:
              <BackSpace> will generate 1m^?  22m(ASCII DEL) and <Delete> will gen-
              erate a special function sequence.


   1mXKB Keyboard Description0m
       The keyboard layout, variant and options components can be also  speci-
       fied directly on the command line.  See the synopsis of the command.

       1m-symbols 4m22mname0m
              Specifies  the  symbols  component  name of the XKB keyboard de-
              scription.

       1m-keycodes 4m22mname0m
              Specifies the keycodes component name of the  XKB  keyboard  de-
              scription.

       1m-rules 4m22mname0m
              The name of the rules file to use.

       1m-model 4m22mname0m
              Specifies the keyboard model used to choose the component names.

       1m-layout 4m22mname0m
              Specifies the layout used to choose the component names.

       1m-variant 4m22mname0m
              Specifies the layout variant used to choose the component names.

       1m-option 4m22mname0m
              Adds an option used to choose component names.

1mNOTES0m
       If  the  option 4m-freebsd24m is used together with 4m-backspace24m 4mdel24m, then the
       key <Delete> will generate the special code 1mfkey7022m.  It is your respon-
       sibility to assign the appropriate sequence to this  special   code  by
       using the following command:

           kbdcontrol -f 70 "`printf '\033[3~'`"
